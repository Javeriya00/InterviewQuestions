### 1. **How do you design and implement CI/CD pipelines using AWS-native services or third-party tools?**
- **Answer**: 
  I have implemented CI/CD pipelines using **AWS CodeCommit**, **CodeBuild**, and **CodePipeline**. In one project, I used **CodeCommit** for source control, **CodeBuild** for compiling and testing Java applications, and **CodePipeline** to automate the release process to an EC2 instance. The pipeline was set to trigger on code pushes, and I integrated **CodeDeploy** for efficient application deployment.  
  Best practices I follow include:
  - Automating testing with each commit using **CodeBuild**.
  - Storing deployment configurations in **AWS Secrets Manager** to ensure secure access.
  - Using **CloudWatch** for logging and monitoring the CI/CD processes to quickly identify and address failures.
  - Ensuring rollback strategies are in place in case of failures.

### 2. **How do you use Terraform to manage AWS infrastructure and ensure consistency across environments?**
- **Answer**: 
  I primarily use **Terraform** to provision AWS resources like **EC2**, **VPCs**, **RDS**, and **IAM roles**. In my last project, I created reusable Terraform modules for infrastructure provisioning, ensuring consistency across different environments (Dev, QA, Prod). For example, I defined a VPC with public and private subnets, and integrated **Security Groups** and **NAT Gateways**.  
  Best practices include:
  - Storing Terraform state in **S3** with **DynamoDB** for locking to avoid concurrency issues.
  - Using **remote backends** for shared environments to maintain state consistency.
  - Defining reusable **modules** for common infrastructure components to ensure DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principles.
  - Writing **variables** and **outputs** for better configuration flexibility and environment-specific changes.

### 3. **How do you integrate security best practices into your CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure provisioning?**
- **Answer**: 
  Security is integrated at every stage of my CI/CD pipeline. For example, I used **SonarQube** for static code analysis during the **build phase** to identify vulnerabilities in the code. For deployment, I ensure all sensitive data like API keys and passwords are stored in **AWS Secrets Manager** and retrieved securely by the pipeline.  
  In terms of infrastructure, I ensure that **IAM roles** have the least privilege, applying **security groups** and **NACLs** to control network access. Additionally, I encrypt sensitive data both in transit and at rest using **AWS KMS**.  
  Best practices:
  - Automate **security scans** early in the pipeline using tools like **SonarQube** and **Snyk**.
  - Use **MFA** for AWS IAM users and enforce strong **password policies**.
  - Store sensitive data in **AWS Secrets Manager** or **Azure Key Vault** to avoid hardcoding secrets.
  - Perform **security audits** using tools like **AWS Inspector** and **CloudTrail**.

### 4. **Can you describe your experience with provisioning AWS resources like EC2, S3, RDS, and IAM?**
- **Answer**: 
  In my projects, I have used **Terraform** and **AWS CloudFormation** to provision key resources like **EC2**, **S3**, **RDS**, and **IAM roles**. For example, I provisioned **EC2 instances** for application deployment, set up **S3 buckets** for file storage, and created **RDS instances** for relational database services. I also use **IAM** to define granular permissions for users and applications to ensure proper access control.  
  Best practices:
  - Use **Auto Scaling Groups** for EC2 to ensure scalability based on traffic patterns.
  - For RDS, configure **Multi-AZ deployments** for high availability.
  - Implement **IAM roles** with minimal permissions, adhering to the principle of least privilege.
  - Enable **S3 versioning** and **encryption** to protect stored data.

### 5. **How do you manage infrastructure configurations using tools like Ansible or Chef?**
- **Answer**: 
  I have experience using **Ansible** for configuration management to automate software deployment and ensure consistency across multiple EC2 instances. For example, I wrote Ansible playbooks to install and configure **Apache** and **MySQL** on a fleet of EC2 instances.  
  Best practices:
  - Use **Ansible roles** to modularize configurations and ensure reusability.
  - Implement **idempotent** playbooks so that configurations can be applied multiple times without causing unintended changes.
  - Store Ansible playbooks in version-controlled repositories for easy tracking and collaboration.
  - Use **Ansible Vault** to manage sensitive information securely, such as database passwords or API keys.

### 6. **How do you integrate monitoring and logging into your AWS infrastructure?**
- **Answer**: 
  I integrate monitoring and logging into my infrastructure using **AWS CloudWatch** and **AWS CloudTrail**. I use **CloudWatch Logs** for logging application and system logs, and set up **CloudWatch Alarms** to notify me of any performance anomalies (e.g., CPU spikes or low disk space).  
  Best practices:
  - Enable **CloudWatch Metrics** for all critical resources, including EC2, RDS, and Lambda.
  - Set up **CloudWatch Dashboards** for real-time monitoring and visibility into the health of applications.
  - Implement **CloudTrail** to log all API activities, helping with auditing and compliance.
  - Leverage **AWS X-Ray** for tracing application performance and pinpointing issues in serverless applications.

### 7. **What is your experience with serverless computing on AWS, such as AWS Lambda and API Gateway?**
- **Answer**: 
  I have worked with **AWS Lambda** to build serverless applications, especially for event-driven architectures. For example, I developed a Lambda function to process data from an S3 bucket and store the processed data in an RDS instance. I used **API Gateway** to expose Lambda functions as REST APIs for frontend applications to interact with.  
  Best practices:
  - Use **API Gateway** for seamless integration between front-end applications and serverless backends.
  - Implement **Lambda Layers** to manage common code across multiple Lambda functions.
  - Set up **Dead Letter Queues (DLQ)** for error handling in Lambda functions.
  - Ensure **IAM roles** used by Lambda functions follow the principle of least privilege.

### 8. **How do you implement Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with AWS CloudFormation or Terraform?**
- **Answer**: 
  I prefer using **Terraform** for defining infrastructure as code because it provides a more flexible, multi-cloud approach. For example, I used Terraform to provision VPCs, subnets, and security groups for AWS resources and manage them in a version-controlled repository. I’ve also used **CloudFormation** when building specific templates that require AWS-specific features, such as **Elastic Beanstalk** deployments.  
  Best practices:
  - Store infrastructure code in **version-controlled repositories** (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
  - Implement **remote backends** for storing Terraform state securely in **S3**.
  - Use **CloudFormation StackSets** for deploying infrastructure across multiple accounts.
  - Continuously test infrastructure code through **Terraform plan** and **CloudFormation change sets** before applying changes.

### 9. **How do you ensure that your AWS infrastructure follows security best practices?**
- **Answer**: 
  I ensure that my AWS infrastructure adheres to security best practices by implementing the principle of **least privilege** with **IAM policies**, using **AWS KMS** for encrypting sensitive data, and setting up **CloudTrail** for continuous auditing. Additionally, I use **AWS Config** to monitor resources for compliance with internal policies and industry standards.  
  Best practices:
  - Regularly review and rotate **IAM credentials** and enable **MFA** for sensitive accounts.
  - Encrypt all sensitive data at rest and in transit using **AWS KMS** and **SSL/TLS**.
  - Use **AWS Config** and **Security Hub** to continuously monitor compliance and detect misconfigurations.
  - Implement **VPC flow logs** for network security auditing.

### 10. **How do you manage application deployments across multiple environments (e.g., Dev, QA, Prod)?**
- **Answer**: 
  I manage deployments across multiple environments using **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** to ensure consistency and reduce manual intervention. For example, I use **Terraform** to provision resources in each environment and **AWS CodePipeline** to automate deployments based on the environment.  
  Best practices:
  - Use separate **AWS accounts** or **VPCs** for different environments to isolate them and ensure security.
  - Create environment-specific configurations using **Terraform variables** or **CloudFormation parameters**.
  - Implement **Blue/Green** or **Canary** deployment strategies to minimize downtime and reduce the risk of errors.
  - Automate rollbacks using **CodePipeline** or **Lambda** functions in case of deployment failures.
